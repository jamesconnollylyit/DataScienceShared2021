# DataScienceShared2021
This is the shared repo for the Data Science module.

This repo contains all of the program code that I discuss and use in each Data Science lecture session.

Check regularly that you have the most recent version of the program code, and sync your repo with this one to access the most recent updates.

Refer to the notes on Blackboard for further information on how to sync your local repo with this one.
